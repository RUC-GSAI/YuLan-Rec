Simulating high quality user behavior data has always been a fundamental problem in human-centered applications, where the major difficulty originates from the intricate mechanism of human decision process. Recently, substantial evidence have suggested that by learning huge amounts of web knowledge, large language models (LLMs) can achieve human-like intelligence. We believe these models can provide significant opportunities to more believable user behavior simulation. To inspire such direction, we propose an LLM-based agent framework and design a sandbox environment to simulate real user behaviors. Based on extensive experiments, we
find that the simulated behaviors of our method are very close to the ones of real humans. Concerning potential applications, we simulate and study two social phenomenons including (1) information cocoons and (2) user conformity behaviors. This research provides novel simulation paradigms for human-centered applications.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- **Novel User Simulation Paradigm:** RecAgent is a novel user simulation paradigm that combines large language models (LLMs) with user behavior analysis. It is designed to simulate the behavior of real users in a recommender system. It also replicates users' social interactions, including chatting and posting. RecAgent can be used to evaluate the performance of recommender systems and to generate user behavior data for training and testing. 

- **Human-like Memory Mechanism:** RecAgent's memory mechanism mimics human cognitive processes, divided into sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. Through efficient compression and scoring of observations, it ensures the relevance and timeliness of information. By combining relevant memory with high-level insights, it achieves more realistic and consistent simulation of user behaviors. 

- **Large Scale Multi-Agent Simulation:** RecAgent is designed for robust, large-scale multi-agent parallel simulations. Seamlessly integrated with multiple OpenAI APIs, it support the capacity to simultaneously engage up to **1000** agents in its simulations. 

- **Multi-dimensional Evaluation:** We conducted an evaluation from two perspectives, that of the agent and that of the system. From the perspective of the agent, we assessed the effectiveness of various types of memory and evaluated whether the agent could access information-rich and relevant memories based on different memory structures. From the system's perspective, we focused on the reliability of the user behavior generated by our system and assessed the efficiency of the simulation.

- **High Extensibility:** RecAgent is designed to support a variety of recommendation algorithms and is equally compatible with multiple LLMs. Both aspects come with interfaces that are easy to customize.

- **Real-time Training and Updating:** RecAgent features an advanced mechanism for real-time training and updating of recommendation models. This allows for the continuous improvement of recommendations based on the latest user interactions and behaviors within the simulation, ensuring that the recommendation system remains dynamic and adaptive to new patterns and preferences.

- **Human-in-the-loop Simulation:** Individuals can create their own Agent to role-play and participate in the entire simulation process. Real people can take the same actions as other Agents, such as watching recommended movies, chatting with other Agents, or posting publicly.

- **Flexible Intervention and Control:** RecAgent provides diverse means to intervene with Agents and monitor the results. An Agent's profile can be freely modified. Moreover, people can intervene with Agents through dialogue. RecAgent also supports saving checkpoints, facilitating retrospective analysis and counterfactual studies.


## ðŸ›  Installation

To install RecAgent, one can follow the following steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/RUC-GSAI/YuLan-Rec.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Using `pip` to install `faiss` may report an error. One solution is to use `conda install faiss-cpu -c pytorch`.
3. Set your OpenAI API key in the `config/config.yaml` file.

### 1. Example

Run the simulation script:

```shell
python -u simulator.py --config_file config/config.yaml --output_file messages.json --log_file simulation.log
```

`config_file` is the path of the configuration file. `output_file` is the path of the output file, which is a JSON file containing all messages generated during the simulation. `log_file` set the path of the log file.

We will obtain some output like:
